	<p>The topics that I picked for this project were alpaca, bacon, board games, coffee, and Ireland.
	I had a mxture of family, friends, and coworkers search these results and screenshot their results.
	Based on the screenshots I was able to determine a point scale that showed me the differences between
	each persons search result for each topic. Following is a screenshot of my Python code that found the
	maximum and minimum number of differences across the searches for each topic based on the point scale.
	It then converts the user input into integers so that I could use the statistics library to find the
	mean, median, and mode of the differences as well.

	<p>For my point system, I categorized a total difference as 1 point, the
	same result in a different order as 0.5 points, and didn't count anything
	that had a repeat across two or more people as a difference. My resoning for
	excluding anything that repeated across two or more people is because in my
	opinion that result was not	truly an outlying difference in my opinion. This
	means that if the same result was in the same location with at least one other
	search, then it was not counted. On the other hand, if it was the same result
	in a different location then it would be given half a point becuase it wasn't
	as drastic as a completely different result. That is why a totally unique
	result obtained the highest pointage.
	</p>
	<p>As far as the results from program, there was a wide range of results across each topic.
	The higest maximum number of differences across all topics was board games with 8 differences,
	where as the lowest maximum was a tie between alpaca, bacon, and Ireland with 3 differences.
	The minimum across all topics were 0. There was always at least one search in each topic that 
	had similarities across all of the other searches. The highest and lowest mean were Ireland with 
	0.75 differences and board games with 3.65 differences respectfully. The median for the topics in
	order as I previously listed are 1.25, 1, 3.75, 2.5, and 0.25. In the same order, the modes are 1, 
	1, 3, 3.5, and 0. Alpaca, bacon, and coffee all had relatively close results, but board games and
	Ireland were outliers in their results. I believe that Ireland was on the lower side of differences
	because not many people that I know are searching for Ireland. Where as board games had more differences
	because everyone had different places to buy board games in their areas, and there were a variety of
	games recommended to buy online for each person. Below I have included screenshots of the results that I
	got from each iteration of the program with the topic data.
