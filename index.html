	  <h2>Scatter Plot</h2>
	<p>When dealing with linear regression, scatter plots are useful because they can demonstrate statistical data such as the average, max, or min of dependant data. 
	Here is the portion of our code that created the scatter plot. We passed two lists into a function and it plotted the data at each index of the lists.

	<p>This lab focused on the height of plants (dependent) based on temperature, rain, altitude, and site number (independent). 
	Here are the scatter plots that were created with our Jupyter code.

	  <h2>Line of Best Fit</h2>
	<p>The line of best fit is a line that based on the data provided that could best predict future trends.The red line in the above graphs are the line of best fit.
	For example, in "Plant Height vs. Temperature" you could predict that in warmer climates, plants grow better. There could be a point where too high temperatures
	could hinder the height, but based on the trend the comparison would be positive. On the other hand, in "Plant Height vs. Altitude" the higher the altitdude, the 
	worst a plant eill grow.
