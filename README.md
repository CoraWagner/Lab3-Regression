# Scatter Plots
When dealing with linear regression, scatter plots are useful because they can demonstrate statistical data such as the average, max, or min of dependant data. This lab focused on the height of plants (dependent) based on temperature, rain, altitude, and site number (independent). Here are the scatter plots that were created with our Jupyter code.
